# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for Beginners

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for Beginners** repository! üöÄ  
This project is designed to help beginners learn DSA concepts with real-world examples and simple code solutions.

---

## About This Project

- This repository includes examples and explanations for various **data structures** and **algorithms**.
- It‚Äôs focused on **beginners**, with step-by-step explanations and clear problem definitions.
- The project is **under development**, and I will be adding more examples and solutions regularly.

---

## Current Contents

### 1. Bubble Sort Algorithm

- **Problem**: Sort customer ratings in ascending order.
- **Example**: A real-world scenario of sorting customer feedback using Bubble Sort.
- **Code**: Available in Python and JavaScript, with comments to explain each step.

### 2. More to Come

- Additional sorting algorithms like quick sort, selection sort and insertion sort.
- Basic data structures like arrays, stacks, and queues.

---

## Features

- Beginner-friendly examples with real-world scenarios.
- Well-commented code in multiple programming languages (starting with Python and JavaScript).
- Focused on helping you learn step-by-step.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bkarimii/DSA-samples-in-JS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder of the algorithm or data structure you want to learn.
3. Read the explanation in the comments and run the code to see how it works.
