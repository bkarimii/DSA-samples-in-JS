Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It repeatedly compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is completely sorted.

How It Works:
1- Start with the first element of the array.
2- Compare it with the next element.
3- If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
4- Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison.
5- Continue until the end of the array, completing one pass.
6- Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the array.
7- The algorithm stops when no swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.
Characteristics of Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity:
Best case:
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) (when the array is already sorted).
Worst case:
𝑂(𝑛2)
O(n2) (when the array is sorted in reverse order).
Space Complexity:
𝑂(1)
O(1) (in-place sorting).
Stable: Bubble Sort maintains the relative order of equal elements.
