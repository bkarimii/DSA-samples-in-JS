# Linear Search

Linear Search is a basic searching algorithm that checks each item in a list one by one to find the target value.

### How it works:

1. Start from the first item in the list.
2. Compare each item with the target value.
3. If a match is found, the search ends successfully.
4. If no match is found, it moves to the next item until the list ends.
